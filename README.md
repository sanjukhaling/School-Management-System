The School Management System I developed is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline various administrative and academic tasks within a school. Built with Django and styled using Bootstrap, the system features an intuitive and responsive interface for seamless navigation across devices. Users can securely log in and out, ensuring data privacy and role-based access control. The application supports robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, enabling efficient management of students, staff, subjects, grades, attendance, exams, and results. By leveraging Bootstrap's powerful components, the design is modern and user-friendly, featuring dynamic elements like search functionality, navigation menus, and visually appealing layouts. This system not only enhances operational efficiency but also provides a centralized platform for managing school activities effectively.
